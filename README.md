# Short Description
# Problem Statement:
During the time of pandemic or during any kind of crisis, the most important thing that a person wants is to keep themselves safe at the time of pandemic. If they are suspected to have got the desease, then they need to get themselves to the testing labs or hospitals. The first thing which comes to their mind in this kind of situation is that they would try to spend minimum time at the place which might have positive patients present during the time of their visit.Optimizing the wait time and completing the task for which they had to visit the labs or hospital as soon as possible is the primary concern.
# Advantage of using the technology:
With the help of technology people can get information, answers to the queries, from the source without even directly interacting with them. They can get help,support and reduce the time gap between initiation of help and getting the help.
# About the Project:
This project deals with the development of an interactive chatbot which would help people get information during the time of pandemic like Covid19. Apart from giving necessary information the chatbot would also ensure to make the life of the people using the chatbot easier. We would be using open source tools, open source machine learning frameworks, IBM cloud, Watson service and other services to give our idea a life and help it to progress in real world.
